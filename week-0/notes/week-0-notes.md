*Why do binary letters start at 65?*
What I think you mean are ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) letters. Because computers can only really understand numbers, they use certain numbers to represent characters.

As to why the letters begin at 65, the first 32 characters are used to give computers that use ASCII instructions such as escape and backspace. Then come the more common characters. For a reason unknown to me, most normally used characters come first, then upper case letters, then more symbols, and finally the lower case numbers. This order causes the A to be positioned at 65, so there isn't a significant reason other than that there are 65 characters before it(0 to 64).

In computer science, conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.
